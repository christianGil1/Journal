                        <p><strong>Describing the department or functional area and its methods of operation:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            During my internship, I worked in the software development department at Fligno Software. This team focuses on creating custom software solutions and operates in an agile, sprint or anything that is suitable for the environment. Each project is managed in phases, from planning and design to development and deployment. Team members collaborate closely, using platforms like GitHub, GitLab, React, Laravel and other project management tools to ensure timelines and deliverables are met.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>As an Intern, how did the department benefit from me?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            As an intern, I contributed to the development of an inventory management system project for Fligno which might be used by the company. My work allowed me to complete the project faster by learning and applying that knowledge to my tasks such as database management, API development in the back-end, and front-end UI design. I also managed to test and debug my code with Postman, ensuring smoother transitions through each project phase.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Summarizing how I spent my hours during practicum, including specific accomplishments:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I spent my hours coding, troubleshooting, and collaborating with colleagues. I was primarily responsible for developing features for the inventory management system using Laravel and React, such as inventory tracking, low-stock alerts, and pagination. My specific accomplishments include creating user-friendly UI components, optimizing API responses, and setting up a responsive front-end design.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>What have I learned from the experience in the company?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            My time at Fligno Software taught me the importance of attention to detail, selfpaced learning, teamwork, and efficient coding practices. I learned how to structure a full-stack application from scratch and gained valuable experience in debugging and optimizing code.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>How was my experience with the people in the company?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The people at Fligno were welcoming and supportive. The employees even my mentor took the time to guide me through complex tasks, providing constructive feedback that helped me improve. I appreciated the collaborative spirit and willingness to help that I found within the team.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>The most memorable event during my practicum:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The most memorable moment was presenting my completed project to the team and receiving positive feedback on my work. It was rewarding to see my contributions being valued and acknowledged by the company.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Recommendations for the company to facilitate practicum experiences in the future:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I would recommend establishing a structured onboarding process for interns, including a list of resources and a dedicated mentor to help them settle in more quickly. This could improve efficiency and make the learning curve smoother for future interns.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Advice for those who will take their practicum in the future:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            My advice for future interns is to ask questions whenever youâ€™re unsure and actively seek feedback on your work. Embrace the learning process and take on challenges, as this is a great opportunity to develop both technical and soft skills.
